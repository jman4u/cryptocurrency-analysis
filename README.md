# cryptocurrency-analysis

This project utilizes data from coinmarketcap.com to plot various characteristics of cryptocurrencies throughout time.

All in all there are 13 graphs/charts, with ten showing
the prices of the top ten cryptocurrencies throughout time, and the last three showing
the top cryptocurrencies by market cap and volume, as well as a look at the overall bitcoin
dominance in the market.
In the future I would be interested in using this format with a continuously updating dataset
Afterall, that is how websites like coinmarketcap essentially do exactly what I do here.
This might be possible by getting live data from all the different exchanges...
But in essence this program provides many useful utilities for graphing data on cryptocurrencies.
